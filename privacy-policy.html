    <h1>Zuzuzoo — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> October 23, 2025</p>
    <p>Operator: <strong>Siarhei Kazachonak</strong> (<a href="mailto:kazachonaksiarhei@gmail.com">kazachonaksiarhei@gmail.com</a>), Poland.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Zuzuzoo ("App", "we", "us", "Operator") collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you use our App. The App is designed for young children (target: up to 4 years) and aims to minimize personal data collection. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the App you agree to the terms described below.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. What data we collect</h2>
    <h3>2.1. No personal data of children</h3>
    <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> intentionally collect personal information of children (for example: names, photos, voice recordings, precise location, contact lists, or other direct identifiers).</p>

    <h3>2.2. Technical and analytics data (non-personal)</h3>
    <p>We collect limited technical and analytics information to provide, maintain and improve the App. This data is anonymous or pseudonymized and may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device information (device model, OS version, app version).</li>
      <li>App usage analytics (events, session length, feature usage).</li>
      <li>Crash reports and logs (collected by Bugfender or similar services).</li>
      <li>Subscription status and purchase receipts handled via Apple/RevenueCat (for billing management).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is used only to support the App and is not used to identify a child personally.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. How we collect data</h2>
    <p>Data is collected via:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Built-in analytics SDKs (e.g., Firebase) for anonymous usage statistics and performance monitoring.</li>
      <li>Crash reporting SDKs (e.g., Bugfender) for diagnosing app stability issues.</li>
      <li>Subscription management services (e.g., RevenueCat) to manage purchase state. Actual payments are processed by Apple via the App Store.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The App does not require account registration and stores user content locally on the user's device unless you choose to export or share content yourself.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Legal bases for processing (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>For EU users (including Poland) our legal bases are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> processing necessary to provide paid subscription services and app functionality.</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> improving the App's stability and features (analytics and crash reports), balanced against user privacy. We do not use analytics to profile children or identify individuals.</li>
      <li>Where required, we will ask for consent before processing data beyond what is described here.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Use of collected data</h2>
    <p>We use data to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and maintain the App and subscription services.</li>
      <li>Monitor, analyze and improve app performance and user experience.</li>
      <li>Detect, prevent and address technical issues and crashes.</li>
      <li>Manage subscriptions and verify purchase state via RevenueCat/Apple.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Disclosure of data to third parties</h2>
    <p>We may share non-personal technical data with the following categories of third parties:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Analytics providers:</strong> Firebase (Google) for aggregated analytics and events.</li>
      <li><strong>Subscription management and billing:</strong> RevenueCat and Apple (App Store) for purchases and subscription state.</li>
      <li><strong>Crash reporting:</strong> Bugfender for crash logs and diagnostics.</li>
      <li>Other service providers who assist in operating the App under contract and only on our instruction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These providers process data on our behalf. Their use of data is governed by their privacy policies.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
    <p>We retain analytics and crash data for a limited period necessary to improve the App and comply with legal obligations. Subscription metadata is retained as long as needed to manage your subscription and for a reasonable period afterward for dispute resolution and accounting. Local app data remains on the user's device unless explicitly exported or deleted by the user.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. International transfers</h2>
    <p>Third-party services we use (e.g., Firebase, RevenueCat, Bugfender) may process data in countries outside the EEA. Where personal data transfer occurs, we ensure appropriate safeguards as required by applicable law. For non-personal analytics data, transfers are used to provide the service and improve the App.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>9. Your rights (EU/GDPR)</h2>
    <p>If you are in the EU, you have certain rights with respect to your personal data. Although the App does not collect personal data of children, if you believe we hold personal data about you or your child, you may request:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access to the data we process about you;</li>
      <li>Correction of inaccurate data;</li>
      <li>Erasure of data where applicable;</li>
      <li>Restriction or objection to processing in certain circumstances;</li>
      <li>Data portability where applicable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, contact the Operator at <a href="mailto:kazachonaksiarhei@gmail.com">kazachonaksiarhei@gmail.com</a>. We will respond within the timeframe required by applicable law.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>10. COPPA and parental controls (United States)</h2>
    <p>Zuzuzoo is intended for young children and is designed to avoid collection of personal information from children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child’s personal information has been collected, please contact us at <a href="mailto:kazachonaksiarhei@gmail.com">kazachonaksiarhei@gmail.com</a> so we can remove such data and take necessary steps in accordance with applicable law (including COPPA).</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>11. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data collected via the App. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure—absolute security cannot be guaranteed. If a data breach occurs that is legally required to be reported, we will follow applicable notification requirements.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>12. Children’s privacy and parental responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Because the App is aimed at young children, parents/guardians should supervise use. We encourage parents to review the App's settings on the device and to manage in-app purchases through Apple. If you want to request deletion of any local data or have questions about children’s privacy, contact us at the address below.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>13. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If changes are material, we will update the Effective Date and provide notice as required by law. Your continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
