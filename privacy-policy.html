  <h1 class="main-title">Zuzuzoo — Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> November 21, 2025</p>
  <p>Operator: <strong>Siarhei Kazachonak</strong> (<a href="mailto:kazachonaksiarhei@gmail.com">kazachonaksiarhei@gmail.com</a>), Poland.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">1. Overview</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Zuzuzoo ("App", "we", "us", "Operator") collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you use our App. The App is designed for young children (ages 2-6) and aims to minimize personal data collection in compliance with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the App you agree to the terms described below.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">2. What data we collect</h2>
  <h3 class="subheading">2.1. No personal data of children</h3>
  <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> intentionally collect personal information of children (for example: names, photos, voice recordings, precise location, contact lists, email addresses, or other direct identifiers that can be used to contact or identify a specific child).</p>

  <h3 class="subheading">2.2. Trial subscription fraud prevention</h3>
  <p><strong>Device Identifier (IDFV):</strong> To prevent abuse of our 3-day free trial subscription, we collect a device identifier (Identifier for Vendor, or IDFV) provided by Apple iOS. This identifier:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Is used <strong>ONLY</strong> to ensure each device receives one free trial per subscription offer.</li>
    <li>Is <strong>NOT</strong> used for advertising, behavioral tracking, profiling, or marketing purposes.</li>
    <li>Is <strong>NOT</strong> shared with third parties for advertising or marketing.</li>
    <li>Is sent only to RevenueCat (our subscription management provider) to enforce trial eligibility rules.</li>
    <li>Cannot be used to identify or contact a specific child.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Why we collect this:</strong> This is necessary to prevent fraudulent abuse of free trials and protect our business from repeated trial misuse. Without this, users could delete and reinstall the app indefinitely to receive unlimited free trials.</p>
  <p><strong>Your control:</strong> Parents may contact us at <a href="mailto:kazachonaksiarhei@gmail.com">kazachonaksiarhei@gmail.com</a> to request deletion of this identifier. Note that trial eligibility is also managed by Apple through your Apple ID and cannot be reset by us.</p>

  <h3 class="subheading">2.3. Technical and analytics data (non-personal)</h3>
  <p>We collect limited technical and analytics information to provide, maintain and improve the App. This data is anonymous or pseudonymized and may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device information:</strong> Device model, operating system version, app version, language preference.</li>
    <li><strong>App usage analytics:</strong> Which features are used, session duration, game completion rates, button taps (e.g., "user completed feeding game"). This data is aggregated and cannot identify individual children.</li>
    <li><strong>Crash reports and diagnostic logs:</strong> Technical error logs collected by Bugfender when the app crashes or encounters errors. These logs include device state, error messages, and app performance data but do not include personal information.</li>
    <li><strong>Subscription status:</strong> Whether a subscription is active, trial status, purchase receipts (handled securely by Apple and RevenueCat).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information is used only to support the App's functionality and stability and is not used to identify a child personally.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">3. How we collect data</h2>
  <p>Data is collected via:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics (Google):</strong> Collects anonymous usage statistics (screen views, feature usage, session times) to help us understand how the app is used and improve user experience. Firebase does not collect names, email addresses, or other personal identifiers from children. Firebase may collect IP addresses for geolocation (country-level only) and technical identifiers for crash reporting.</li>
    <li><strong>Bugfender:</strong> Collects crash reports and diagnostic logs when the app encounters technical issues. Bugfender logs include device information, app state, and error messages but do not include personal data such as names or photos.</li>
    <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Manages subscription state and trial eligibility. RevenueCat receives the device identifier (IDFV) and subscription status to enforce trial rules. Actual payment processing is handled securely by Apple via the App Store; we never see or store credit card information.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The App does not require account registration. All app content (saved progress, preferences) is stored locally on the user's device and is not transmitted to our servers.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">4. Legal bases for processing (GDPR)</h2>
  <p>For EU users (including Poland) our legal bases are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> Processing necessary to provide paid subscription services and app functionality (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR).</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> Improving the App's stability, performance, and features through analytics and crash reports (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR). We have balanced this interest against user privacy and determined that minimal, anonymized data collection does not pose significant privacy risks. We do not use analytics to profile children or create individual user profiles.</li>
    <li><strong>Fraud prevention:</strong> Collecting device identifiers to prevent trial subscription abuse is a legitimate interest to protect our business and ensure fair access to trials (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not rely on consent as our primary legal basis, but where required by law, we will ask for explicit parental consent before processing data.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">5. Use of collected data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and maintain the App and subscription services.</li>
    <li>Enforce trial eligibility rules and prevent subscription fraud.</li>
    <li>Monitor, analyze and improve app performance, stability, and user experience.</li>
    <li>Detect, prevent and address technical issues, crashes, and bugs.</li>
    <li>Manage subscriptions and verify purchase state via RevenueCat and Apple.</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations and respond to lawful requests from authorities.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>NOT</strong> use collected data for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Targeted advertising or behavioral profiling.</li>
    <li>Selling or renting data to third parties.</li>
    <li>Contacting users directly (we have no contact information).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="heading">6. Disclosure of data to third parties</h2>
  <p>We share limited data with the following trusted third-party service providers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase (Google LLC):</strong> Anonymous usage analytics and crash reporting. Firebase Privacy Policy: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></li>
    <li><strong>RevenueCat (RevenueCat, Inc.):</strong> Subscription management and trial eligibility enforcement. RevenueCat receives device identifiers (IDFV) and subscription status. RevenueCat Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy</a></li>
    <li><strong>Bugfender (Mobile Jazz SL):</strong> Crash logs and diagnostic information for debugging purposes. Bugfender Privacy Policy: <a href="https://bugfender.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://bugfender.com/privacy-policy</a></li>

  </ul>
  <p>These service providers are contractually obligated to protect user data and use it only for the purposes we specify. We do not sell or rent user data to any third parties.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">7. Data retention</h2>
  <p>We retain data only as long as necessary to provide services and comply with legal obligations:</p>

    <li><strong>Subscription metadata:</strong> Retained for 7 years to comply with tax and accounting regulations, then deleted.</li>
    <li><strong>Local app data:</strong> Stored only on the user's device and can be deleted by uninstalling the app or clearing app data in iOS settings.</li>

    <li>Adequacy decisions for certain countries.</li>
    <li>Service providers' compliance with GDPR, COPPA, and other privacy frameworks.</li>
  </ul>
