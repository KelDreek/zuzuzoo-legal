  <h1 class="main-title">Zuzuzoo — Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> October 23, 2025</p>
  <p>Operator: <strong>Siarhei Kazachonak</strong> (<a href="mailto:kazachonaksiarhei@gmail.com">kazachonaksiarhei@gmail.com</a>), Poland.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">1. Overview</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Zuzuzoo ("App", "we", "us", "Operator") collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you use our App. The App is designed for young children (target: up to 4 years) and aims to minimize personal data collection. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the App you agree to the terms described below.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">2. What data we collect</h2>
  <h3 class="subheading">2.1. No personal data of children</h3>
  <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> intentionally collect personal information of children (for example: names, photos, voice recordings, precise location, contact lists, or other direct identifiers).</p>

  <h3 class="subheading">2.2. Technical and analytics data (non-personal)</h3>
  <p>We collect limited technical and analytics information to provide, maintain and improve the App. This data is anonymous or pseudonymized and may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device information (device model, OS version, app version).</li>
    <li>App usage analytics (events, session length, feature usage).</li>
    <li>Crash reports and logs (collected by Bugfender or similar services).</li>
    <li>Subscription status and purchase receipts handled via Apple/RevenueCat (for billing management).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information is used only to support the App and is not used to identify a child personally.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">3. How we collect data</h2>
  <p>Data is collected via:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Built-in analytics SDKs (e.g., Firebase) for anonymous usage statistics and performance monitoring.</li>
    <li>Crash reporting SDKs (e.g., Bugfender) for diagnosing app stability issues.</li>
    <li>Subscription management services (e.g., RevenueCat) to manage purchase state. Actual payments are processed by Apple via the App Store.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The App does not require account registration and stores user content locally on the user's device unless explicitly exported or shared by the user.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">4. Legal bases for processing (GDPR)</h2>
  <p>For EU users (including Poland) our legal bases are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> processing necessary to provide paid subscription services and app functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> improving the App's stability and features (analytics and crash reports), balanced against user privacy. We do not use analytics to profile children or identify individuals.</li>
    <li>Where required, we will ask for consent before processing data beyond what is described here.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="heading">5. Use of collected data</h2>
  <p>We use data to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and maintain the App and subscription services.</li>
    <li>Monitor, analyze and improve app performance and user experience.</li>
    <li>Detect, prevent and address technical issues and crashes.</li>
    <li>Manage subscriptions and verify purchase state via RevenueCat/Apple.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="heading">6. Disclosure of data to third parties</h2>
  <p>We may share non-personal technical data with the following categories of third parties:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Analytics providers:</strong> Firebase (Google) for aggregated analytics and events.</li>
    <li><strong>Subscription management and billing:</strong> RevenueCat and Apple (App Store) for purchases and subscription state.</li>
    <li><strong>Crash reporting:</strong> Bugfender for crash logs and diagnostics.</li>
    <li>Other service providers who assist in operating the App under contract and only on our instruction.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="heading">7. Data retention</h2>
  <p>We retain analytics and crash data for a limited period necessary to improve the App and comply with legal obligations. Subscription metadata is retained as long as needed to manage your subscription and for a reasonable period afterward. Local app data remains on the user's device unless explicitly deleted by the user.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">8. International transfers</h2>
  <p>Third-party services we use (e.g., Firebase, RevenueCat, Bugfender) may process data in countries outside the EEA. For non-personal analytics data, transfers are used to provide the service and improve the App.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">9. Your rights (EU/GDPR)</h2>
  <p>If you are in the EU, you have certain rights with respect to your personal data. Although the App does not collect personal data of children, if you believe we hold personal data about you or your child, you may request:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access to the data we process about you;</li>
    <li>Correction of inaccurate data;</li>
    <li>Erasure of data where applicable;</li>
    <li>Restriction or objection to processing in certain circumstances;</li>
    <li>Data portability where applicable.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To exercise these rights, contact the Operator at <a href="mailto:kazachonaksiarhei@gmail.com">kazachonaksiarhei@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">10. COPPA and parental controls (United States)</h2>
  <p>The App is intended for young children and is designed to avoid collection of personal information from children under 13. Parents may contact us at <a href="mailto:kazachonaksiarhei@gmail.com">kazachonaksiarhei@gmail.com</a> for questions or to request removal of data.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">11. Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data collected via the App. Absolute security cannot be guaranteed.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">12. Children’s privacy and parental responsibilities</h2>
  <p>Parents should supervise use and manage in-app purchases via Apple settings. Local data remains on the device unless explicitly deleted or exported.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">13. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy. Your continued use indicates acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
