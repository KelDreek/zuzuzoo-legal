  <p>The App contains no violent content, profanity, sexual content, or realistic depictions of harm. All content is age-appropriate and educational.</p>
  
  <h3 class="subheading">2.2. Parental supervision</h3>
  <p>Parents and guardians should review these Terms and our Privacy Policy before allowing their child to use the App. Parental supervision is recommended, especially for in-app purchases and subscription management.</p>

  <h3 class="subheading">2.3. Device requirements</h3>

    <li>iPhone.</li>
    <li>At least 200 MB of free storage space.</li>
    <li>Internet connection for initial download, subscription purchases, and subscription validation (offline play supported for core features).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="heading">3. Account and registration</h2>
  <p>The App does not require account creation or registration. All app data (game progress, preferences) is stored locally on your device. If account features are added in the future, they will be governed by these Terms and our Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">4. Subscriptions and payments</h2>
  
  <h3 class="subheading">4.1. Subscription types and pricing</h3>
  <p>The App offers the following subscription options:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>3-day free trial:</strong> Access all premium features free for 3 days. After the trial, the subscription automatically converts to a paid subscription unless canceled at least 24 hours before the trial ends.</li>
    <li><strong>Monthly subscription:</strong> $4.99 USD per month (or equivalent in your local currency). Billed monthly after the free trial ends.</li>
    <li><strong>Annual subscription:</strong> $44.99 USD per year (or equivalent in your local currency). Billed annually after the free trial ends.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Price confirmation:</strong> Prices are displayed in your local currency as determined by the App Store. Always confirm the final price before completing your purchase in the Apple Pay or App Store payment screen. Prices may vary by country due to currency conversion and local taxes.</p>
  
  <h3 class="subheading">4.2. In-app purchases</h3>
  <p>Subscriptions are purchased through Apple's in-app purchase system. By subscribing, you agree to Apple's Terms of Service and payment policies. We do not process payments directly and do not store your payment information.</p>

  </ul>
