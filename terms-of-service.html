  <h1 class="main-title">Zuzuzoo — Terms of Service</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> October 23, 2025</p>
  <p>Operator: <strong>Siarhei Kazachonak</strong> (<a href="mailto:kazachonaksiarhei@gmail.com">kazachonaksiarhei@gmail.com</a>), Poland.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">1. Acceptance of these Terms</h2>
  <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the mobile application <strong>Zuzuzoo</strong> ("App") provided by Siarhei Kazachonak ("we", "us", "Operator"). By downloading, installing or using the App you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">2. The App and intended audience</h2>
  <p>Zuzuzoo is an educational/entertainment application designed primarily for young children (target age: up to 4 years). The App is designed to minimize collection of personal data and to be safe for young children. Parents or legal guardians should review these Terms and the Privacy Policy before allowing children to use the App.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">3. Account & Registration</h2>
  <p>The App can be used without creating an account. No user registration is required. If you create any account feature in the future, it will be subject to these Terms and the Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">4. Subscriptions, Trials and Payments</h2>
  <p><strong>Subscription types:</strong> Zuzuzoo offers a free trial for new users and paid subscription plans: a 7-day plan and a monthly plan.</p>
  <p><strong>Free trial:</strong> New users may receive a 3-day free trial. After the 3-day trial ends, the subscription will automatically renew into the selected paid plan (7-day or monthly) and the applicable fee will be charged to your Apple ID account.</p>
  <p><strong>Billing and payment processing:</strong> All payments and subscriptions are processed through Apple's in-app purchase system (StoreKit/Apple). By subscribing you authorize Apple to charge and manage recurring billing. We do not process card payments directly.</p>
  <p><strong>Automatic renewal:</strong> Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can manage or cancel subscriptions via your Apple ID account settings.</p>
  <p><strong>Cancelling trial to avoid charges:</strong> You may cancel the free trial anytime before it converts to a paid subscription. If you cancel during the trial, you will not be charged. To avoid charges, cancel the trial through your Apple ID subscription settings before the trial ends.</p>
  <p><strong>Refunds:</strong> All refund requests for purchases are handled by Apple (App Store). Please contact Apple Support for refund requests. We may assist where possible but cannot issue refunds directly for App Store purchases.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">5. Third-party services</h2>
  <p>The App uses third-party services for analytics, subscription management and crash reporting (for example Firebase, RevenueCat/StoreKit, and Bugfender). These services collect technical and analytics information as described in the Privacy Policy. Use of those services is subject to their terms and privacy policies.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">6. Intellectual property</h2>
  <p>All content, design, graphics, text, icons, and software in the App are the property of the Operator or licensed to the Operator. You may use the App on your personal devices according to these Terms. You agree not to copy, modify, redistribute or create derivative works of the App except as expressly permitted by law.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">7. Acceptable use</h2>
  <p>You agree not to use the App for unlawful purposes or in ways that violate these Terms. You must supervise children's use of the App consistent with good parenting practices and applicable law.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">8. Disclaimers and limitation of liability</h2>
  <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available". To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Operator disclaims all warranties, whether express or implied. The Operator is not liable for indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages arising out of your use of the App, except where liability cannot be excluded by law.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">9. Updates and changes</h2>
  <p>We may modify these Terms or the App at any time. If material changes are made to these Terms, we will update the Effective Date and, where required by law, provide notice. Continued use of the App after such changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">10. Governing law and jurisdiction</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Poland. Any dispute arising from these Terms will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Poland, except where mandatory local consumer protection laws provide otherwise.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">11. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about these Terms, please contact:</p>
